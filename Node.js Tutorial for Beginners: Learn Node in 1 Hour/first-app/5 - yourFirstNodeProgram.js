// your first node program

// run code with node using

// `node <nameOfFile>`

// example:
// node app.js

// node is going to give app.js

// this logs `Hello <name>!` to the console

// if we try to console.log(window), we get a reference error that window is not defined

// remember, in node.js, we don't have the window or document objects

// these are part of the runtime environment we get with browsers.

// we have other objects to work with files in node, the OS, the network, and so on.
